## Motivation

Artificial Neural Networks are computational models based on the structure and functions of a  biological neural network. They are considered a nonlinear statistical data modeling tool that presents complex relationships between the input and the output.

## How biological neurons works

It is possible to state that the human brain is capable of: adapting through learning, behaving according to context, operating with partial knowledge, presenting high memory capacity, parallel and real-time processing. These abilities are the result of the biological neural networks acting.

The core component of the nervous system and the brain, is the neuron (nerve cell). A neuron can be defined as an electrically excitable cell that is capable of doing synapses (to processes and transmits information by electrochemical signalling).

More specifically, the synapse occurs when the axon of a neuron and the dendrite of another neuron gather. They are capable of receiving and sending signals incredibly fast and from/to a lot of other neurons

The neuron can be seen as a device capable of receiving an input from several other neurons and propagating its output.

The human brain has about 10<sup>11</sup> neurons and each neuron makes, on average, between one and ten thousand synapses. Being the number of synapses higher than 10<sup>14</sup>, it is possible to say that the biological neural network presents high complexity.

## Definition of Artificial Neural Networks

> "An Artificial Neural Network is a massively parallel and distributed system composed of simple processing units that have a natural ability to store and use knowledge" (Bellman, 1999)

> "A artificial neural network is a circuit composed by a large quantity of simple processing units inspired on the biological neural system." (Nigrin, 1993)

## When to use Artificial Neural Networks

In practical terms, an ANN is nothing more than a mathematical model used when there is the need for modeling a system with incomplete theoretical knowledge to the point of making the traditional systematic modeling unfeasible. The problems that can be solved by artificial neural networks, usually present:

- Variables with unknown relationship or mathematically intractable.
- Multidimensionality.

We can use Artificial Neural Networks to make predictions through sets of values but they are mainly used as a classification tool.

## McCulloch-Pitts Neuron

The very first artificial neuron model used on artificial neural networks was proposed by McCulloch and Pitts in _A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity_ on 1943. It assumed that the neuron presents a logical function. The proposed structure was an abstraction of the real neural activity on real neural systems and, although very simple, it was proven extremely versatile and easy to modify. It served as inspiration to most of future connectionist models developed.

## Perceptron

On 1958, Frank Rosenblatt introduced the concept of perceptron, which is a cognitive model that consists on sensorial units connected to a single layer of McCulloch-Pitts neurons, adding the idea of adjustable synapses.
