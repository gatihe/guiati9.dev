#### Human Information Processing

Memory is a set of processes used to store and retrieve information on different periods of time. It is possible to define three types of memory:

- Iconic memory: It is very fast. It acts without we realize and it is constantly triggered as we watch the world around us. The iconic memory is associated to a set of pre-attentive attributes.
- Short term memory: Responsible for briefly storing the information while it is being processed.
- Long term memory: Responsible for permanently store information.

Memory is highly related to learning but should not be confused with learning. There are three main processes involved in human memory: encoding, storing and retrieving.

It is possible to state that data visualizations will only be effective if they operate on principles that respect how visual perception and cognition work.

Some good practices to explore the stages of memorization while designing data visualizations are:
- Use contrast and colors to attract initial attention;
- Create associations between familiar objects to help viewers keeping the information.
- Break complex (or long) contents into smaller chunks and use the link between these chunks to build the big picture.

#### Pre-attentive attributes

Pre-attentive processing is the unconscious accumulation of information from the environment. Your eyes and brain absorb large amounts of information and then filter and process what's important. Information that stands out because of certain stimuli or because it is relevant to what you are thinking are selected for a more attentive (conscious) processing.

Pre-attentive attributes are basic elements of visualization and can be related to the shape, color, spacial positioning and other attributes of an object.

(Ware, Coli, 2013) defines four categories of pre-attentive attributes:

1. Shape
2. Hue
3. Spatial positioning
4. Movement

##### Pre-attentive attributes for quantitative data

According to Mazza (2009), the best pre-attentive attributes in order of accuracy for quantitative data are:
1. Position
2. Size
3. Orientation
4. Area
5. Volume
6. Color, hue and texture

##### Pre-attentive attributes for categorical data

When handling categorical data, good choices for pre-attentive atributes are:
1. Color
2. Shape

#### Gestalt Principles of Design

Gestalt represents a set of rules/factors that leads us to perceive (or fail to perceive) certain information. The Gestalt psychology states, amongst other statements, that the human brain is programmed to see structure, logic and patterns even when there are not.

##### Proximity:
- Visual entities that are close to each other are perceived as a group or unity;
- The blank space can be used to group elements and separate others;
- Spatial or temporal proximity of elements induces the mind to perceive them collectively.

##### Continuity:
Continuous dashes (or dots) are more easily perceived than contours that change their steering quickly.

It is clear that A is bigger than B, B is bigger than C and so on. This kind of arrangement is related to the continuity law of Gestalt.

##### Similarity:

Similar objects are perceived as a group. Our minds groups similar elements into collective entities. This similarity can be based on form, hue, size, shine or any other characteristic.

##### Closure:

The mind tends to close contours to complete regular figures, "completing failures" and increasing regularity. There are no need for shady areas or borders in order to the information to look complete.
