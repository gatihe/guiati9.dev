## Introduction

While applying classical logic to solve problems it is possible to identify that it values bivalent analysis (the objects used are either true or false), that is, it presents low tolerance with limit values that end up being excluded. But the real life requires multivalent thinking in order to be better studied, it isn't 'all black and white'.

Some examples that enforce the concept of multivalent approach are:
- In judicial matters, a judge and the jury must consider the degree of guilt of an accused depending on the laws and evidence against the accused;
- Classification of healthy patients;
- Classification of objects as 'large';
- Classification of people as 'tall'.

*Fuzzy logic* aims to capture different degrees of truth that exists in real life. Some formal definitions are:

> Fuzzy logic is capable of combining the inaccuracy associated with natural events and the computational power of machines to produce systems with smart, robust and flexible results. - COX, Earl. Fuzzy logic for business and industry - 1995

>Fuzzy logic allows the development of systems that represents human decisions, to which the conventional (boolean) math and logic is proven to be insufficient or inefficient. - VON ALTROCK, Constantin. Fuzzy logic and neuroFuzzy applications in busines and finance - 1996

It is possible to tell if a concept is fuzzy or not if it should not be defined in an extreme way. Concepts like 'healthy', 'depressed' and 'tall' are good examples, once there are not only 'tall' and 'not tall' people in the world. There are degrees of certainty (or doubt) to which people can be classified as 'tall' or 'not tall'.

The Fuzzy Logic was first proposed by Zadeh, who demonstrates this concept through the Fuzzy Set Theory.

## Classical Set Theory

Formal representations of the Set Theory:

- Set: set of objects that shares some common specific characteristic. According to Classical Set Theory a object can only present two different relationship with a set, that is, it may or may not be an element of the set.

- Membership: An element _x_ is an element of set A: x E A.

- Characteristic function: Establishes the membership relationship between an element _x_ and a set A.

Being A a set and f its characteristic function:

f(x) =  { 1 if x E A}

        { 0 if x ËœE A}

Graphically, f(x) is given by:
