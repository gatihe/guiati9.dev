#### Human Information Processing

Memory is a set of processes used to store and retrieve information on different periods of time. It is possible to define three types of memory:

- Iconic memory: It is very fast. It acts without we realize and it is constantly triggered as we watch the world around us. The iconic memory is associated to a set of pre-attentive attributes.
- Short term memory: Responsible for briefly storing the information while it is being processed.
