Data visualization consists of methods and techniques of graphical representation of information and data trough charts and maps. It provides a accessible way of understanding trends, outliers and patterns in data.


#### Anscombe's Quartet

Anscombe's Quartet is a group of four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics (such as mean, variance, correlation and linear best fit) and yet look very different when charted.

The Anscombe's Quartet is a good example of the importance of data visualization. Oftentimes, calculating the basic statistics for a dataset is not enough to fully understand the domain of the question being analyzed. Even worst, it can lead to wrong interpretations of the data.

### Main Contribuitions to Data Visualization

**1786**: Willian Playfair has designed the first bar and line charts (on "*The Commercial and Political Atlas*"). He is also responsible for the invention of the pizza chart.

**1854**: John Snow (British physician) discovers the transmitting source of cholera and registered using a map the location of obit occurrences.
